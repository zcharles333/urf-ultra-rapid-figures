                    On April 1, 2014, Riot Games, the creators of League of Legends, introduced a radically new game mode called Ultra Rapid Fire (URF), that instantly became a favorite for League fans everywhere. URF was a fast-paced, high-energy game-mode that completely disrupted the delicate order of evenly balanced champions and items found in normal games. Though the game mode was only around for two weeks, Riot re-released it on April 1, 2015 for a limited time only. Ultra Rapid Figures is a d3 visualization that explores the issue of balance in the new URF game mode in League of Legends. It is our intention that, with this visualization as a tool, players will be able to take advantage of the newly-arisen power disparity among champions and dominate their opponents.
