Our project is located in the "project" folder. The central html page is "vis.html", and it loads all of the graphs which are created in the js files. These js files are champ-profiles.js, win_rate.js, force.js, KDA.js, and game_duration.js. These are located in the "/js" folder. The libraries that we used are Bootstrap, JQuery, Ajax, and D3, and the source files for those are located in "/lib" folder. The images that we used are located in the "/img" folder, and the data we used are located in  the "/data" folder.
